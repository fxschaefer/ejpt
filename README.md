##Information Gathering
Information Gathering is the first step of any penetration test. It's one of the most important phases, because any further steps are relying on the information we've gathered. Typically we can devide Information-Gathering in two categories:
- Passive Information Gathering
- - Identifying IP addresses & DNS information
 - Identifying domain names and domain ownership information
-- Identifying email addresses and social media profiles
-- Identifying web technologies being used on target sites
-- Identify Subdomains

- Active Information Gathering
-- Discovering open ports on target systems
-- Learning about the internal infrastructure of a target network/organization
-- Enumerating information from targets
