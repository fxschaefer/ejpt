## Information Gathering
Information Gathering is the first step of any penetration test. It's one of the most important phases, because any further steps are relying on the information we've gathered. Typically we can devide Information-Gathering in two categories:
- Passive Information Gathering
-- Identifying IP addresses & DNS information
-- Identifying domain names and domain ownership information
-- Identifying email addresses and social media profiles
-- Identifying web technologies being used on target sites
-- Identify Subdomains

- Active Information Gathering
-- Discovering open ports on target systems
-- Learning about the internal infrastructure of a target network/organization
-- Enumerating information from targets


## Passive Information Gathering
### Website Recon and Footprinting
- host hackersploit.org -> DNS lookup and get IP-Addresses -> if more than one ipv4 / ipv6 than a proxy or firewall (cloudflare etc.) is likely used by this website.
- check robots.txt file -> is used to refuse crawlers to certain directories / what files should not be indexed
- check sitemap.xml / sitemaps.xml -> provide search engines a sturcture for indexing
- buildwith -> firefox plugin for website technology and cms detection
- wappalyzer -> quite the same as buildwith
- whatweb hackersploit.org -> command for identifying web technologies and plugins that is used (equivalent to plugins mentioned above)
- httrack -> program to copy a website locally for further analysis
- whois hackersploit.org or who.is website-> query dns register

### Website Footprinting with Netcraft
- netcraft.com -> Scan a website for technology, network information, first seen, hsoting history, basic ssl vulnerability check etc.
- Easy to consume infos (collection of all methods / commands mentioned above)


### DNS Recon
- dnsrecon -d gkd-group.com -> get all dns records (NS, A, TXT, MX ..)
- dnsdumpster.io -> best dns reconnaicance tool for organized information!!!

### Detect WAF with wafw00f
- wafw00f http://www.gkd-group.com -> check if a waf is used

### subdomain enumeration with sublist3r
- sublist3r -d [DOMAIN] (opt. -t threads; -b bruteforce; -e search engines)
- -b belongs to active reconnaicance.

### Google Dorks
- site: -> limit all results to a given Domain e.g. site: gkd-group.com; site:*.ine.com -> show all subdomains that have been indexed by google.
- inurl: -> search for a part of a url e.g. site:gkd-group.com inurl:wp-content
- intitle: -> specific keyword in site-title
- filetype: -> show all files of a specific filetype e.g. pdf
- intitle:index of -> common vulnerability of directory listing.
- cache: show older versions of a website (for more details better use waybachmachine -> web.archive.org
- Use GOOGLE HACKING DATABASE (GHDB) on exploit-db.com to show some interesting queries.

### E-Mail Harvesting with theHarvester
- "theHarvester" command / program is preistalled on Kali & Parrot
- theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b linkedin -> searches for linkedin information to a given domain
- spyse source is very interesting but requires a subscription

### Leaked Password Databases
- good for password spraying ;)
- haveibeenpwned.com -> Aggregates various databreaches all over the world



## Active Information Gathering

### DNS Zone Transfers
A DNS Zone Transfer is the process to move zone Files from one DNS-Server to another. If misconfigured and left unsecured, this functionality can be abused by attackers to copy the zone files from the primary DNS server to another DNS server. A DNS Zone transfer can provide penetrations testers with a holistic view of an organizations network layout.
